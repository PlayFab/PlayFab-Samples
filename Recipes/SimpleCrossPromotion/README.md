## Simple In-Game Cross Promotion 
### Description:
This example shows off how you can use Player Publisher Data to reward players that play more than one of your games. This mechanic depends on each client "checking-in" after Authentication. The check-in process occurs in Cloud Script's secure environment. Mechanics like this are a useful tool when running a cross-promotional campaign to your existing players. 

### Ingredients (Building Blocks):
  * [Accounts](https://api.playfab.com/docs/building-blocks#Accounts)
  * [Title Data](https://api.playfab.com/docs/building-blocks#Title_Data)
  * [Player Data](https://api.playfab.com/docs/building-blocks#Player_Data)
  * [Player Inventory](https://api.playfab.com/docs/building-blocks#Player_Inventory)
  * [Virtual Currency](https://api.playfab.com/docs/building-blocks#Virtual_Currency)
  * [Catalog & CatalogItems (Bundle / Container)](https://api.playfab.com/docs/building-blocks#Catalog)
  * [Cloud Script](https://api.playfab.com/docs/building-blocks#Cloud_Script)

### Preparation:
  1. Use the Game Manager to configure a second Virtual Currency for your title:

  | Property | Value | Detail
  ---: | :---: | --- 
  Code | GM | Abbreviation for our VC
  Name | Gems | Name of our VC
  Initial Deposit | 5 | How many each player gets with a new account

  2. Upload [this example catalog](/Recipes/SimpleCrossPromotion/PlayFab-JSON/Catalog.json) or use your own.
	  * If using your own, ensure that you have items that can be granted to players.
  3. Upload & deploy [this Cloud Script](/Recipes/SimpleCrossPromotion/CloudScript.js), or ensure that yours has corresponding methods.  
  4. Add the following TitleData record:
	  * **Key** : CrossPromotionalRewards
	  * **Value**: 
	  ```javascript
{ 
	//your title ID : the item to award for playing this title
  "E5A" : "chromePaint",  
	"632D" : "biggerHat" 
}
``` 
  5. To properly test this you will need to have multiple titles with the similar Cloud Scripts & TitleData. This pattern allows you to have different rewards for each individual catalog. Ensure that your 2nd and third titles match the values in your TitleData:CrossPromotionalRewards (See step #4).

### Mechanic Walkthrough:
  1. Client obtains a valid session ticket via one of the various authentication pathways (required to make Client API Calls)
  2. Client checks-in via calling into the Cloud Script method "CheckIn". 
  3. Cloud Script reads the Player Publisher Data and determines if the player is elidigible for a reward.
  4. Award results passed back to client for updating the player.


### Cloud Script:
In this example we are using Cloud Script to act as the secure server ensuring that the CheckIn logic processing and item grants happen on a trusted machine. The results of any actions performed in Cloud Script are then passed back to inform the client.
