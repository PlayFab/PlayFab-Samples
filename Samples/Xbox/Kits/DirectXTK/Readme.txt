DirectXTK - the DirectX Tool Kit for DirectX 11
-----------------------------------------------

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

August 21, 2019

This package contains the "DirectX Tool Kit", a collection of helper classes for
writing Direct3D 11 C++ code for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps for
Windows 10, Xbox One, Windows 8.x Win32 desktop applications and
Windows 7 Service Pack 1 applications.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, Visual Studio 2017,
or Visual Studio 2019. It is recommended that you make use of VS 2015 Update 3,
Windows Tools 1.4.1, and the Windows 10 Anniversary Update SDK (14393) -or-
VS 2017 (15.9 update) / VS 2019 with the Windows 10 October 2018 Update SDK (17763).

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the
legacy DirectX SDK. For details, see "Where is the DirectX SDK?"
<https://aka.ms/dxsdk>.

--------
XBOX ONE
--------

* Developers using the Xbox One XDK need to generate the
  Src\Shaders\Compiled\XboxOne*.inc files to build the library as they are not
  included in the distribution package. They are built by running the script
  in Src\Shaders - "CompileShaders xbox" from the "Xbox One XDK Command Prompt".
  They are XDK version-specific. While they will continue to work if outdated,
  a mismatch will cause runtime compilation overhead that would otherwise be
  avoided.


-------------
RELEASE NOTES
-------------

* The VS 2017/2019 projects make use of /permissive- for improved C++ standard
  conformance. Use of a Windows 10 SDK prior to the Fall Creators Update (16299)
  or an Xbox One XDK prior to June 2017 QFE 4 may result in failures due to
  problems with the system headers. You can work around these by disabling this
  switch in the project files which is found in the <ConformanceMode> elements.

* The VS 2017 projects require the 15.5 update or later. For UWP and Win32
  classic desktop projects with the 15.5 - 15.7 updates, you need to install the
  standalone Windows 10 SDK (17763) which is otherwise included in the 15.8.6 or
  later update. Older VS 2017 updates will fail to load the projects due to use
  of the <ConformanceMode> element. If using the 15.5 or 15.6 updates, you will
  see "warning D9002: ignoring unknown option '/Zc:__cplusplus'" because this
  switch isn't supported until 15.7. It is safe to ignore this warning, or you
  can edit the project files <AdditionalOptions> elements.

* The UWP projects include configurations for the ARM64 platform. These require
  VS 2017 (15.9 update) or VS 2019 to build.
